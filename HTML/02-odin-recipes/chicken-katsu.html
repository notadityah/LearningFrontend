    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chicken: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and
        promotes browning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or
        vegetable oil.
      </li>
    </ul>
